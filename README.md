# OkHttp Demo Project

**Course:** IX608001 Intermediate Application Development Concepts  
**Assignment:** Practical 3 - Java Library/Framework Study  
**Library:** OkHttp  
**Students:** Roshan Aryal

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the comprehensive usage of OkHttp, a modern HTTP client library for Java applications. OkHttp is developed by Square Inc. and provides an efficient way to make HTTP requests with advanced features like connection pooling, caching, interceptors, and HTTP/2 support.

## What is OkHttp?

OkHttp is an HTTP client that's efficient by default:
- **HTTP/2 support** allows all requests to the same host to share a socket
- **Connection pooling** reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn't available)
- **Transparent GZIP** shrinks download sizes automatically
- **Response caching** avoids the network completely for repeat requests
- **Interceptors** provide powerful middleware capabilities
- **Clean API** with fluent builder pattern for readable code

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

### 1) What is the aim of OkHttp?
OkHttp aims to be an efficient HTTP client by default, providing:
- Modern protocol support (HTTP/2, WebSockets)
- Automatic performance optimizations
- Clean, intuitive API design
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Extensive customization through interceptors

### 2) In which type of projects/problems can you use it?
- **REST API Integration** - Consuming web services and APIs
- **Mobile Application Development** - Android app backend communication
- **File Upload/Download Operations** - Transferring files over HTTP/HTTPS
- **Web Scraping and Data Extraction** - Automated content retrieval
- **Microservices Communication** - Service-to-service HTTP calls
- **Integration Testing** - HTTP endpoint testing and validation
- **Real-time Applications** - WebSocket connections for live data

### 3) Architecture (Main Components)
```
Application Layer
       ↓
   OkHttpClient (Configuration Hub)
       ↓
    Request Builder (Fluent API)
       ↓
      Call (Executable Request)
       ↓
  Interceptors (Optional Middleware)
       ↓
   Connection Pool + Network Layer

    Response Object
```

**Key Components:**
1. **OkHttpClient** - Central configuration point, manages connection pooling and global settings
2. **Request** - Immutable HTTP request representation with URL, headers, and body
3. **Response** - HTTP response container with status, headers, and response body
4. **Call** - Represents a request ready for execution (sync/async)
5. **Callback** - Interface for handling asynchronous response processing
6. **Interceptors** - Middleware for monitoring, logging, authentication, and request/response modification
7. **ConnectionPool** - Manages HTTP connections for reuse and performance
8. **Cache** - Optional HTTP response caching mechanism

### 4) How to use OkHttp with IntelliJ? (Four Examples)
